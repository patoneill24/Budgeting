## Overview

**Project Title**: Budget Tracker

**Project Description**: A budget tracker that allows users to create budgets and track their spending.

**Project Goals**: Provide a simple interface for users to set a budget and track their spending. I would also like to add a feature that allows users to track their progress for the budget they set.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Go to visual studio code website and download the Java coding pack for your operating system (Windows or Mac).
2. Create a java project by searching in vs code, "Java: Create Java Project. You will then be prompted to name your project and select a location to save it.
3. Insert the files in the src folder from the repository into the src folder of the project.
4. Run the program by clicking the run button in the top right corner of the screen.
Instructions for using the software:

1. When the program is run, Create a budget by selecting the month and year you would like to create a budget for.
2. Create categories for your budget and enter in the amount you want to budget for each category.
3. Enter in expenses for each category and the program will keep track of the total amount spent over the budgeted amount.
4. Save your budget and expenses by entering option 4 and pick a file name to save it to. You can then load the budget and expenses by entering option 6 and selecting the file you saved it to.
5. Press 7 to exit the program.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Visual Studio Code
* openjdk 
* Coding Pack for Java
* Other extensions for Java in Visual Studio Code such as Debugger for Java

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Java Programming Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)
* [File Handling in Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_files_create.asp)
* [Stacks in Java](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-class-in-java/)


## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Creating a GUI for the program
* [ ] Adding a feature that shows visual representation of the budget and expenses (ie charts)
* [ ] Adding a feature that allows users to compare their past budgets and expenses


Here's additional information about the project that was created when the project was initialized:


## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
